- In addition to the API for registering games, a very basic UI page was implemented to consume this API. The project uses the Datatable plugin that works with jQuery making Ajax calls to send and bring data making them available in a dynamic table. 
- The use of the Toaster plugin has been demonstrated, which displays a success or error notification message when inserting or editing games.
- Plugins were imported via CDN distribution.
- There are two profiles to choose from when running the project: IISExpress (page UI) and IISExpress API (Swagger).
